# Supervision & Jury Member

I am currently helping in the supervision of *Antoine Gratia* who made a Master's thesis on modeling the variability of CNN architectures and that is now starting a PhD at the university of Namur under the supervision of Dr. Gilles Perrouin and Prof. Pierre-Yves Schobbens.
During my post-doc, I also supervised two other PhD students: *Géraldin Nanfack* (PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Benoît Frénay) and *Sophie Fortz* (PhD student under the supervision of Dr. Gilles Perrouin).

During my PhD, I have worked with Clémentine Delambily, *Hugo Martin* and Léo Noël-Baron; all of them were brillant student helping during summers 2017 and 2018.
In 2023, I supervised *Camille Molinier* who performed his internship at the University of Namur under the supervision of Dr. Gilles Perrouin.

In June 2019, I was member of the jury (president jury) at the defense of _Samraa Alzubi_. She defended her Master thesis in cybersecurity entitled _Black-Box Adversarial Reprogramming Attack Against Convolutional Neural Networks Using Genetic Algorithm_.

The same year, I was also involved in the jury evaluating the work of _Simon Genin_ to obtain his Master's degree.
This Master's thesis was supervised by Prof. Benoît Frénay and Prof. Benoît Vanderose.

Since then, I am involved in the jury of 2 masters students at the university of Namur every year. These juries involve: Céline Delhaye, Hugo Devillers, Piotr Banach, Audrey Gilson, Olivier Chevalier and Oliver Welcomme.

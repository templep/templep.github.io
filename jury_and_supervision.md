# Supervision & Jury Member

### PhD supervision

#### Current

* Malvin Chevallier* started his PhD in October 2025. More to come.

* Valere Billaud* started his PhD in October 2025, after a 6-month period as an engineer in the DiverSE team. He is working on LLM-generated code and is specifically interested in detecting inserted vulnerabilities so that we can better understand the generation process and try to prevent them upfront. The end of his work is expected by the end of 2028.

* Camille Molinier* started his PhD in October 2024. He is focusing on trying to robustify the evolution of ML models in the context of Federated Learning using software testing and software engineering methods. The end of this work is expected in 2027.

* Martin Molli* started his PhD in November 2024. He is mainly supervised by Dr Daniel Balouek and Prof. Thomas Ledoux (IMT Atlantique Nantes, members of the STACK team). Martin tries to use ML and software variability techniques to manage and optimize, in a smooth way, application placement and service placement in the computing continuum. The end of this work is expected in 2027 (or early 2028).

* Brell Peclard Sanwouo Chekam* started his PhD in 2024. He is mainly supervised by Dr Clément Quinton (University of Lille, member of Spirals team). Brell is looking at how Agentic AI can improve system architectures and make them more autonomous. His dream would be to propose the next evolution of the MAPE-K loop. The end of this work is expected in 2027.

#### Past
After his Master's thesis, *Antoine Gratia* started his PhD under the supervision of Dr. Gilles Perrouin and Prof. Pierre-Yves Schobbens. He focused on modeling CNN architectures with variability-aware techniques but also tackled the problem of trying to optimize their energy consumption while keeping an acceptable level of accuracy. It basically turned into a multi-objective optimisation problem. Antoine defended in 2025.

During my post-doc, I also supervised two other PhD students: *Géraldin Nanfack* (PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Benoît Frénay) and *Sophie Fortz* (PhD student under the supervision of Dr. Gilles Perrouin).
Géraldin worked on the definition and enforcement of constraints in ML algorithms (especially decision trees) to make them meet some domain constraints. He defended in 2022.
Sophie worked on automated learning problems (with DL or L* algorithm) associated with Featured Transition Systems. FTSs help reasoning over the behavior of configurable systems, so being able to model them automatically or pair execution traces to different variants of the systems is very hard yet important. She defended in 2023.

### Internships
During my PhD, I have worked with Clémentine Delambily, *Hugo Martin* and Léo Noël-Baron; all of them were brillant student helping during summers 2017 and 2018.
During my post-doc, in 2021, I helped in the supervision of *Antoine Gratia* who made a Master's thesis on modeling the variability of CNN architectures.
In 2023, I supervised *Camille Molinier* who performed his internship at the University of Namur under the supervision of Dr. Gilles Perrouin.

### Jury

#### PhD
I acted as a jury member in the PhD defenses of Géraldin Nanfack, Antoine Gratia, and Valentin Delchevalerie (UNamur PhD student supervised by Prof. Benoit Frenay).

#### Masters
In June 2019, I was member of the jury (president jury) at the defense of _Samraa Alzubi_. She defended her Master thesis in cybersecurity entitled _Black-Box Adversarial Reprogramming Attack Against Convolutional Neural Networks Using Genetic Algorithm_.

The same year, I was also involved in the jury evaluating the work of _Simon Genin_ to obtain his Master's degree.
This Master's thesis was supervised by Prof. Benoît Frénay and Prof. Benoît Vanderose.

Since then, I am involved in the jury of 2 masters students at the university of Namur every year. These juries involve: Céline Delhaye, Hugo Devillers, Piotr Banach, Audrey Gilson, Olivier Chevalier and Oliver Welcomme.

In 2023 and 2024, I volunteered to supervise (from the academic perspective) ESIR students for their final internship. This implies meeting them at least once during their internship but also to be part of jury sessions. These are time slots (often 2 hours) in which different student will present the work achieved during their internship. The defense is typically 20 minutes long, followed by 10 to 15 minutes of questioning by the jury members.

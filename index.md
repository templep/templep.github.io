# Presentation

I am a 2-nd year PhD student working in the IRISA lab in the [DiverSE](http://diverse.irisa.fr/) working group in Rennes (France).

My supervisors are [Mathieu Acher](http://www.mathieuacher.com/) and [Jean-Marc JEZEQUEL](http://people.irisa.fr/Jean-Marc.Jezequel/).

I am working on testing Computer vision algorithms with the use of Software Engineering techniques. (more in the background section)

Furthermore, I am a tennis player. I began to play tennis at 6 until my 18. I stopped to focus on my studies and started again during my PhD.

## Background

After graduating in Computer Science with a fous on Data Image Processing (a 2-years diploma teachning fundamentals of a panel of facets of computer science, including OS, Programming, Mathematics, Web technologies, network managing, Systems design, etc.)from the Institute of Technology of Lannion (France); I went to ESIR (Ecole Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Rennes, Rennes, France), an engeeniering school where I chose to continue focusing on Data Image Processing.
During the last year of ESIR, I also graduated from the University of Rennes 1 with a Master in Computer Science with a focus on introducing the world of research to student.
Thus, I have a strong background in Data Image Processing (as well as Machine Learning) on one hand and in Softwarer Engineering thanks to my PhD on the other hand.

## Topics of interest
* Computer Vision
* Software Testing

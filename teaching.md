# Teaching activities
*2025-2026*:
   * V & V (Session labs and lectures for a total of 24h): 30 to 40 M1 (or equivalent) students; introduction to software testing, verification and validation. Reverse classes.
   * DevOps (Session labs and lectures for a total of 24h): (about 40) M1 (or equivalent) students; about the aim of DevOps in companies and the necessity of having continuous feedbacks.
   * Programming (C++ and 36h): (about 15) L3 (or equivalent) students. Introduction to Object Oriented Programming, class hierarchy, memory management, iterators.
   * Introduction to Object Modeling (Session labs for 24h): in charge of the MIAGE class (about 80 M1 or equivalent students). Introduction to class and object diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams. Students had to do a project to apply these different diagrams to understand that some description can be ambiguous.
